	None were added or modified
	The majority of our argument passing was implemented in 
	the pintos2 starter code that we were insturcted to use.

			---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do

>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page? 
   
	Most of argument passing was implemented in the starter code.

	Argument parsing was implemented in the starter code.

	The elements in argv[] are arranged in correct order with the
	reverse function. The reverse function copies all pointers in
	argv[] to a temporary array in reverse order, then all pointers
	are placed back into argv[].

	Avoiding overflowing the stack page was implemented in the
	starter code.

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()? 

	   SAVE_PTR is the address of a `char *' variable used to keep
	   track of the tokenizer's position.  The return value each time
	   is the next token in the string, or a null pointer if no
	   tokens remain. -- taken from string.c file
	
	   strtok_r() uses that third argument to keep track of where the 
	   tokenizer is at. This makes its safe for multi-threading. strtok()
	   uses static variables that can be accessed by different threads, thus
	   meaning it is not safe for multi threading. 
	   
	   --multithreading!!

>> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into an executable name
>> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
>> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

	   1. It's more advanced/efficient. With tab-completion, piping and 
	   by being able to redirect files, then the execution of these files
	   are spread out via the PATH variable.
	  
	   2. UNIX also parses the user input for you in the shell. This means 
	   that the kernel does not have to do it, making the kernel more simple
	   and the system more secure. 
	   
	   -- less processing that the kernel has to do. 
	   
			     SYSTEM CALLS

			---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

	N/A - all of our structures were implemented for us in starter code
	
	We utilized the file descriptor provided for us
	in the starter code struct to find the files.
	However, we utilized this struct wait_list in our process_wait function
	and the list of file descriptors provided for us. 
	The lock was used so that only one system call 
	could be made to a file at a time.
		

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

	File descriptors are unique within each process. The
	thread has a list of its own file descriptors. 
	This file descriptor struct was implemented for us in the
	starter code and is associated with the open files. 
	
	Each process's thread has its own list of file descriptors.
	
	/* A file descriptor, for binding a file handle to a file. */
	struct file_descriptor
	  {
	    struct list_elem elem;      /* List element. */
	    struct file *file;          /* File. */
	    int handle;                 /* File handle. */
	  };

			---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

	Code for the writing function was already implremented in the
	starter code. We used a majority of this code to implement the 
	ready system call. 
	1. Look up file descriptor with handle
	2. lock the file system
	3. determine number of bytes to read/write
	4. make sure we can still use the page
	5. call to file_read() or file_write()
	6. Recount how many bytes we have read/written, go back to 
		2 if less than total
	7. Release lock


>> B4: Suppose a system call causes a full page (4,096 bytes) of data
>> to be copied from user space into the kernel.  What is the least
>> and the greatest possible number of inspections of the page table
>> (e.g. calls to pagedir_get_page()) that might result?  What about
>> for a system call that only copies 2 bytes of data?  Is there room

	Least = 1 if all of the bytes are on page
	Greatest  = could be (4096 * 2) = 8192 if all of the bytes
	are on individual pages
	??????

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
>> and how it interacts with process termination.

   1. Get current thread, create iterator 
   2. Sort through children list for current thread
   3. if child is a child of current process then
	i. sema_down to make child alive
	ii. return exit_code
   4. if we get through entire loop, return -1

	When system calls failed, we always returned -1. However, 
	if we wanted the call to quie we called thread_exit() or 
	sys_exit(-1). We also ensure error checking by aquiring and
	releasing the lock before and after we make the file system	
	call. We also 'malloc'ed the size of our file pointer and then 
	'palloc'ed and freed our pointers when we were finished using them
	We also use the verify_user function to make sure that pages are 
	still available when we want to read/write to them. 

			---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

	In our starter code, sys_exec calls process_execute and that
	was implemented for us. The load success/failure status is passed
	to our exec call through our bool sucess in our exec_info struct.
	We set this to true as we start the process. In our sys_exec, 
	we pass the file and then we utilize the bool success as we start 
	our process.
	

>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you
>> ensure proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P
>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are
>> there any special cases?
	
	We iterate through the list of the current thread's children list
	and ensure that we don't return the exit code of the incorrect child thread.
	If the current thread (P) terminates before the child thread can exit, 
	then all of the current thread children's list will be freed as cur exits.
	If wait is called after the child exits, then the current thread won't find 
	the child and will return -1 after iterating. 
	We free all of the resources when the processes exits. 

			---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?
	
	Copy_in_string() function was implemented in the starter code
	and allowed for us to more quickly move memory from user to kernel
	memory.

>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

	The file descriptors make it much quicker to find the files.
	Generally, I would have used an iterator but the file handle
	makes the much more efficient.

>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

	We did not change it. 

			   SURVEY QUESTIONS
			   ================

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future quarters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want--these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the quarter.

>> In your opinion, was this assignment, or any one of the three problems
>> in it, too easy or too hard?  Did it take too long or too little time?

	Too hard, took too much time, would have been nice to start with 
	pintos 2 from the get go. It is hard to know how to start the project
	when we don't discuss some of the concepts in depth in class time.

>> Did you find that working on a particular part of the assignment gave

	No.
